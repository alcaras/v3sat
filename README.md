# Victoria 3 Save Analysis Tools (V3SAT)

A comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing Victoria 3 save files, converting them from compressed binary format to JSON for easier analysis and generating detailed reports and visualizations.

## Quick Start

1. **Download Rakaly**: Download the Rakaly binary for your platform from [https://github.com/rakaly/librakaly](https://github.com/rakaly/librakaly)
   - Create a `rakaly/` directory in this folder
   - Place the `rakaly` binary inside (make sure it's executable: `chmod +x rakaly/rakaly`)

2. **Copy Victoria 3 game data**: Copy these directories from your Victoria 3 installation to this folder:
   - `common/` (from `Victoria 3/game/common/`)
   - `events/` (from `Victoria 3/game/events/`)  
   - `localization/` (from `Victoria 3/game/localization/`)
   
   **Where to find your Victoria 3 installation:**
   - **Steam (Windows)**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Victoria 3\game\`
   - **Steam (macOS)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 3/game/`
   - **Steam (Linux)**: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 3/game/`
   - **Game Pass**: `C:\XboxGames\Victoria 3\Content\game\`

3. **Place your save files**: Copy your Victoria 3 save files (`.v3` files) into the `save-files/` directory

4. **Extract a save file**:
   ```bash
   python3 extract_save.py "YourSaveFile.v3"
   ```

5. **Generate all reports**:
   ```bash
   ./run_all_reports.sh
   ```

That's it! All reports will be generated in a timestamped directory under `reports/`.

```

## Configuration

### Human Countries Tracking
Edit `humans.txt` to specify which countries are human-controlled. This filters many reports to focus on player nations:

```
GBR
USA
FRA
ITA
# Add your player countries here
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Rakaly binary**: Download from [https://github.com/rakaly/librakaly](https://github.com/rakaly/librakaly)
- **Victoria 3 game data**: Copy from your Victoria 3 installation (see setup above)
- **Python packages**: 
  - matplotlib, pandas (for basic charts)
  - plotly, kaleido (for interactive treemaps - run `pip install plotly kaleido`)
  - squarify (for simple treemaps - run `pip install squarify`)

## Understanding the Data

### GDP Sampling
Victoria 3 samples GDP data **every 7 days**, not the 28 days shown in the data structure. Our tools use the correct 7-day sampling for accurate historical reconstruction.

### Multiplayer Bug Handling
Victoria 3 has a bug where GDP history is lost when players leave/rejoin. Use the `--session3` parameter in gdp_timeseries.py to merge data from previous saves when needed.

### Foreign Ownership
We provide 5 different foreign ownership analysis methods:
- **Simple**: Basic building counts
- **Detailed**: By building types
- **By Entity**: Companies vs other ownership types
- **Full GDP**: GDP-weighted analysis
- **True GDP**: Most accurate using Victoria 3's actual formula

## Data Accuracy

Our tools have been validated against Victoria 3's internal calculations:
- ‚úÖ GDP calculations match the game's formula exactly
- ‚úÖ Military scoring uses actual unit statistics
- ‚úÖ Time series data validated across multiple save files
- ‚úÖ Foreign ownership percentages confirmed accurate

## Troubleshooting

**"rakaly not found"**: Download Rakaly binary and place in `rakaly/rakaly`
**"No save files found"**: Place `.v3` files in `save-files/` directory
**"Permission denied"**: Make sure rakaly binary is executable (`chmod +x rakaly/rakaly`)
**"Module not found"**: Install required Python packages (`pip install plotly kaleido squarify`)
**"Game data not found"**: Copy `common/`, `events/`, and `localization/` directories from your Victoria 3 installation

## Contributing

This toolset analyzes Victoria 3's save file format using [Rakaly](https://github.com/rakaly/librakaly) for binary-to-JSON conversion. Game data definitions must be copied from your Victoria 3 installation.

For questions or improvements, ensure you have the required game data directories from your Victoria 3 installation.
